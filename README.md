# **AgroTrade – Empowering Farmers through Barter and Web 3 Technology**

## **Project Overview**

AgroTrade is a Web 3-powered platform designed to address the market access and pricing challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Nigeria. By leveraging blockchain technology, AgroTrade enables farmers to trade agricultural goods and services through a secure, transparent barter system, bypassing the need for cash and traditional credit systems. The platform also provides real-time price data, ensuring that farmers have access to fair and accurate information to guide their trade decisions.
